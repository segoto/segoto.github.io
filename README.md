# Personal web page (1st project ISIS-3710)
This is my first web course project at Universidad de los Andes. The goal is to develop a personal website that shows information about ourselves, 
such as academic information, work experience, hobbies,among other facts. This web page must be developed with some basic concepts teached on the first
2 weeks of class.

## Technologies used:
The technologies I used to develop my web page were html, css, bootstrap 4 and Javascript. 

## Additional information:
You may find this website at https://segoto.github.io, otherwise you may clone this repository and with a local server such as lite-server plugin in VsCode
you may see it working.
